# Therefore

Implementation of simple corner balance (SCB) on both an source iteration (SI) and one cell inversion (OCI) scheme with time dependence. Numba acceleration used. Ability to compute spectral radius of either convergence method.

Integration tests and runs of interest with plots: 
1. Jupyeter notebook
2. In this directory `python reeds_problem.py`
3. In this directory `python spec_rad.py`

# Dependencies:
1. Python
2. Numba
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

## Odds and Ends
This project started off of work done in NSE653: Advanced Particle Transport Program class at Ore. St. Unv.
The name *Therefore* comes from linking words that the illustrious Todd S. Palmer hates, as he feels they are pretentious.
Other words in this category include: Aforementioned, Thus, Hence, Wherefore, Whence etc.
Please include these words in all work accordingly.
